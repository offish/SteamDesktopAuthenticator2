SteamDesktopAuthenticator2 (SDA2) allows you to confirm trade and market transactions directly from your browser. While it is named SDA2 for convenience, it is not affiliated with [Jessecar96](https://github.com/Jessecar96) or the original [SteamDesktopAuthenticator](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator) project. SDA2 was created because the original SDA project is no longer receiving updates and has become slow when there are many pending confirmations.
