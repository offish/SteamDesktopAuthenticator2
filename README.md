SteamDesktopAuthenticator2 (SDA2) allows you to confirm trade and market transactions directly from your browser. While it is named SDA2 for convenience, it is not affiliated with [Jessecar96](https://github.com/Jessecar96) or the original [SteamDesktopAuthenticator](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator) project. SDA2 was created because the original SDA project is no longer receiving updates and has become slow when there are many pending confirmations.

- Python 3.10 or greater installed
- A browser with the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension

## Setup
Clone the repository.
Place your maFile(s) inside the `maFiles` directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your maFile(s) are encrypted, you need to also include your `manifest.json`.

If the maFile(s) are unencrypted, you only need the maFile(s) in the `maFiles` directory. These can be named whatever, but has to have the `.maFile` filetype.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Open your browser which has Tampermonkey installed.

### [Install the Tampermonkey user script](https://github.com/offish/SteamDesktopAuthenticator2/raw/refs/heads/main/userscript/SteamDesktopAuthenticator2.user.js)

Now you can go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to confirm trade and market transactions.
You need to allow Tampermonkey to make requests.
